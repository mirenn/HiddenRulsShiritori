# Progress Report (as of 2025-05-16)

## Project: Hidden Rule Shiritori Game

### Current Progress
- Initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
- Room matching UI implemented (4-digit code, player name, join/create button).
- WebSocket connection hook created (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`) and basic server-side WebSocket logic implemented (`server/index.ts`) for real-time communication.
- Game screen displays after joining, showing room code, player name, and connection status.
- Shiritori core logic implemented (game rules, turn management, input, history) with WebSocket-based real-time synchronization for 2-player gameplay.
- Hidden rules defined (`src/utils/hiddenRules.ts`) and basic point system implemented on the server-side (`server/index.ts`). Some rules requiring Gemini API are placeholders.
- Rating system UI component created (`src/components/RatingDisplay.tsx`) and localStorage-based rating storage and update logic implemented (`src/utils/ratingStorage.ts`, `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`).
- Basic server-side structure for handling game logic, player connections, and room management is in place (`server/index.ts`).
- Environment variable setup for API keys (`.env`).

### Next Steps
- Implement Google Gemini API integration for dynamic hidden rule evaluation (client-side `src/utils/hiddenRules.ts` and server-side `server/index.ts`).
- Refine and thoroughly test the WebSocket-based real-time synchronization, including edge cases and error handling.
- Enhance UI/UX based on gameplay testing.
- Conduct comprehensive testing of all game features.

---
The project has achieved significant progress in implementing core gameplay mechanics, real-time multiplayer functionality via WebSockets, and the rating system. The immediate focus is on integrating the Gemini API for advanced hidden rule capabilities and ensuring robust real-time synchronization. See `game-requirements.md` for full requirements.
