## Project: Hidden Rule Shiritori Game

### Current Progress
- Initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
- Room matching UI implemented (4-digit code, player name, join/create button).
- Placeholder game screen displays after joining (shows room code, player name).
- 2-player room state management using localStorage and polling.
- Shiritori core logic implemented (game rules, turn management, input, history) with localStorage sync for 2-player alternation.
- Rating system UI component created (`src/components/RatingDisplay.tsx`).
- WebSocket connection hook created (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`).
- Basic server-side structure initiated (`server/index.ts`).

### Next Steps
- Implement hidden rules and point system.
- Finalize rating system (localStorage).
- Integrate Google Gemini API.
- Implement WebSocket-based real-time synchronization (server and client).

The project currently features front-end implementation for 2-player Shiritori, including game logic and turn management. Server-side WebSocket implementation is a priority for real-time online play. This document summarizes the current implementation status. See `game-requirements.md` for full requirements.
